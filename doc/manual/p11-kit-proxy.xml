	<title>Proxy Module</title>

	<para>When an application is aware of the fact that coordination
	is necessary between multiple consumers of a PKCS#11 module, and wants
	to load standard configured PKCS#11 modules, it can link to
	<literal>p11-kit</literal> and use the functions there to provide this
	functionality.</para>

	<para>However most current consumers of PKCS#11 are ignorant of
	this problem, and do not link to p11-kit. In order to solve this
	multiple initialization problem for all applications,
	<literal>p11-kit</literal> provides a proxy compatibility
	module.</para>

	<para>This proxy module acts like a normal PKCS#11 module, but
	internally loads a preconfigured set of PKCS#11 modules and
	manages their features as described earlier. Each slot in the configured modules
	is exposed as a slot of the <literal>p11-kit</literal> proxy module. The proxy
	module is then used as a normal PKCS#11 module would be. It can be loaded by
	crypto libraries like NSS and behaves as expected.</para>

	<para>The <literal>C_GetFunctionList</literal>,
	<literal>C_GetInterfaceList</literal> and <literal>C_GetInterface</literal>
	exported entry points of the proxy module returns a new managed PKCS#11 module
	each time it is called. These managed instances are released when the proxy
	module is unloaded.</para>
